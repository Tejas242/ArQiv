# Overview

ArQiv is a state-of-the-art search engine designed specifically for the ArXiv research corpus. It leverages efficient data structures and diverse ranking algorithms to deliver rapid and highly relevant search results, even on modest hardware.

## Key Objectives

- **Speed:** Achieve near-real-time search performance using an inverted index combined with bitmap-based acceleration.
- **Accuracy:** Provide multiple ranking methods including BM25 and TF-IDF to ensure the most relevant results are returned.
- **Scalability:** Employ parallel processing and modular design for handling large datasets.
- **Flexibility:** Support advanced, semantic search via optional BERT-based ranking.

This document offers a high-level introduction to the project, its core concepts, and the key technologies powering ArQiv.

## Core Components

- **Data Module:**  
  Loads and preprocesses ArXiv metadata into standardized `Document` objects.

- **Indexing Module:**  
  Implements an inverted index, complemented by a trie for prefix matching and a bitmap index for fast boolean operations.

- **Ranking Module:**  
  Contains traditional (BM25, TF-IDF) and advanced (Fast Vector, optional BERT) ranking algorithms.

- **User Interface:**  
  A rich CLI application built with the Rich library that provides an intuitive search experience.

This overview sets the stage for the subsequent documentation sections.
