# ArQiv Overview

ArQiv is a next-generation search engine tailored for ArXiv papers. Its unique blend of optimized data structures and diverse ranking methods makes it both lightning-fast and highly accurate.

## What Makes ArQiv Stand Out?

- **Speed:** Combines an inverted index with bitmap acceleration for near-real-time responses.
- **Accuracy:** Integrates traditional (BM25, TF-IDF) and advanced (Fast Vector, optional BERT) ranking.
- **Scalability:** Built with parallel processing and modular design to handle varying dataset sizes.
- **Flexibility:** A rich CLI and an interactive Streamlit web app ensure accessibility for all users.

ArQiv transforms how researchers discover relevant work in the vast world of ArXiv.
