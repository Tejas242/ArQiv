# Additional Notes and Insights

This document provides further technical insights and considerations regarding ArQiv’s design and potential enhancements.

## Practical Insights

- **Indexing Example:**  
  Consider a document with the sentence “Deep learning transforms research.” After preprocessing, tokens such as `['deep', 'learn', 'transform', 'research']` are indexed, allowing rapid retrieval when matching query terms like “learn.”

- **Query Caching:**  
  The implementation uses an LRU cache to store recent query results, thereby significantly reducing latency on repeated searches.

## Design Trade-offs and Considerations

- **Scalability:**  
  Using a combination of an inverted index, trie, and bitmap index provides a balance between memory usage and query speed.

- **Modular Ranking:**  
  The multiple ranking strategies (BM25, TF-IDF, Fast Vector, and optional BERT) allow users to choose based on accuracy requirements versus computational constraints.

- **Parallel Processing:**  
  Employing Python’s `ProcessPoolExecutor` for index construction enables ArQiv to handle large datasets fast by distributing the workload.

## Future Directions

- **Hybrid Ranking Models:**  
  Combining traditional relevance scoring with semantic analysis can further improve result quality.
- **UI Enhancements:**  
  Development of a web-based interface or improvements to the CLI would improve usability.
- **Distributed Indexing:**  
  Scaling the indexing process across multiple machines to handle even larger datasets.

These insights are intended to provide context and direction for future work on ArQiv.
