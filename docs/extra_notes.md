# Additional Insights

## Practical Considerations

- **Indexing Efficiency:**  
  Parallel processing drastically reduces indexing time, making it viable for large document sets.

- **Query Caching:**  
  An LRU cache speeds up repeated queries, ensuring near-instant result delivery.

## Design Trade-offs

- **Memory vs. Speed:**  
  In-memory indexes yield rapid searchesâ€”balancing memory usage is key on low-spec hardware.
  
- **Algorithm Diversity:**  
  Multiple ranking algorithms (BM25, TF-IDF, Fast Vector, optional BERT) offer flexibility in tailoring search results to different needs.

## Future Enhancements

- **Hybrid Ranking Models:**  
  Integrate traditional and semantic ranking.
- **Scalable Architectures:**  
  Explore distributed indexing and database backends.
- **Enhanced UI:**  
  Further improvements to the CLI and web interfaces for better usability.

These insights provide directions for future improvements while highlighting current strengths.
